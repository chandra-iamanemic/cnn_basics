### How do computers see images

First lets understand how a computer sees an image as opposed to how we see an image.

Let us take a grayscale image of a cat, we humans see a cat with ears, nose, eyes and other distinguishable features, but what 
a computer sees is just a lot of numbers stacked in a matrix.
